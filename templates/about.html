<p>I'm interested in the science of learning as it applies outside the classroom. I'm a writer and editor by trade and I also do a lot of Python coding. </p>

<p>Cian and I follow a semi-structured approach to home education, which for us means I plan the English and Maths work and we follow Cian's interests for other subjects. </p>
